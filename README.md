# Threat-Intel-Automation-on-OPNsense-Firewall
In this cybersecurity project, we primally focus on the implementation of a Virtual 
Local Area Network (VLAN) as a robust defense mechanism to safeguard network 
communications between two distinct systems, exemplified by Windows and Ubuntu 
operating environments. The primary focus of this endeavour is to establish an effective 
defense against potential cyber threats by creating a specialized firewall with dynamic 
threat detection capabilities.

The VLAN setup entails segregating the network into isolated segments, ensuring 
controlled and secure data flow between the Windows and Ubuntu systems. The 
centrepiece of our approach is the development of an efficiency firewall system. This 
firewall is designed to actively monitor and analyze incoming and outgoing traffic, 
promptly identifying and responding to any suspicious or malicious IP addresses or 
Domain Name System (DNS) requests. Upon detection, the firewall will employ an 
adaptive blocking mechanism, effectively curtailing any unauthorized communication 
attempts while simultaneously triggering real-time alerts to network administrators.
Through the fusion of VLAN segregation and a proactive firewall, this project aims to 
enhance the overall security posture of the networked environment. By thearting 
potential threats at the communication level and providing instantaneous alerts, the 
proposed system offers a potent line of defense against unauthorized access, data 
breaches, and malware propagation. This project's innovation lies in its holistic 
approach to fortifying network security, thereby contributing to the broader realm of 
cybersecurity practices
